Haskell
=======
We're looking for someone with "real world" production experience of Haskell ideally 
(while recognising that there's a somewhat untapped pool of people who love Haskell and
are good at it, but haven't had an opportunity to do it at their day job yet).
Additional skills and experience that we'd regard highly are:

• Web experience - any front end work you've done, especially with Angular. 

• Financial experience - a lot of the ideas in the platform have grown out of
  dissatisfaction in building trading systems.

• Architecture "stuff" ØMQ, Elastic Search, rabbitmq, Cloud Haskell,
  Continuous Integration - anything sexy you've done or like. Wow us!
